##Task 1: Simple operations

#print(5 - 6)
#print(8 * 9)
#print(6 / 2)
#print(5 / 2)
#print(5.0 / 2)
#print(5 % 2)
#print(2 * (10 + 3))
#print(2 ** 4)

#print(10 / 3)
#print(10 % 3)

##Task 2: Practising with variables

#age = 5
#age = "almost three"
#a_longer_name = "hello, CFG!"

#age = 29.5
#age = "I really don't know!"

#print(age)
#print(a_longer_name)

#print("hello " + "world")
#print("hello", "world")

##Task 3: Basic string manipulation

#print("Bob" * 3)
#print("Bob" + "3")
#print("hello".upper())
#print("GOODBYE".lower())
#print("the lord of the rings".title())

#age = "I don't know."
#printAge = type(age)
#print(printAge)

#S1 = "hello " + "world"
#S2 = "Joke" * 3
#S3 = 5
#print(S1 + S2 * 10)
#print(S1 + S2 + str(S3))
#strExample = "a,b,b,d,happy"
#print(strExample.split(","))

##Task 4: String formatting

age = 5
like = "painting"
age_description = "My age is {} and I like {}.".format(age,like)
print(age_description)
age_description_two = "My age is {0} and I like {1}.".format(age,like)
print(age_description_two)
age_description_three = "My age is {0} and I like {1}. My brother also likes {1}.".format(age,like)
print(age_description_three)
age_description_four = "My age is {0} and I like {1}. My brother is also {0} and also likes {1}.".format(age,like)
print(age_description_four)
#testingQuotes = """does this work?"""
#print(testingQuotes)
#"""
#this should be ignored?
#"""
#test_return = """Can you add
#returns if you use
#three quotes?"""
#print(test_return)
#
##Homework
#
#a = 1
#a = a + 1
#print(a)
#b = "hello"
#print(b)
#c = b.title()
#print(b)
#print(c)
#d = "hello"
#e = d.title()
#print(d)
#print(e)
#name = "Dave"
#f = "Hello {0}!".format(name)
#print(f)
#name = "Sarah"
#print(f)
#print(f * 5)
